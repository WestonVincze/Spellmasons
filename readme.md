## Getting Started
- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) on your development machine
- Clone this repository with git ([learn more about git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos))
- In your console, run `npm install`, then `npm start`.  Navigate a browser (Chrome recommended) to http://localhost:3000/ and you're good to go!  It will automatically refresh when changes are made to the code.
- Underworld.ts is the file that contains most of the game state.  Checkout Unit.ts and Player.ts too to get started making changes!


## Development Tips
- Press F12 to open the console (this works in the Steam version of the game too!)
- If you set `adminMode = true` in the console,  you can then `Shift + Left Click` during a live game to open the admin menu which allows you to spawn things and change unit stats.
- You can access the current game state in the console via `devUnderworld`.  To get you started messing around with the game in the console, move your character's position with the following: `devUnderworld.players[0].unit.x += 100`.
- Important note, there are some development-only features (such as auto picking upgrades) that are meant to speed up development.  If you need them off, go to the console (F12) and type `devAutoPickUpgrades=false;`

## License
Please read and respect the [license](./LICENSE.md).  I am making this software publicly available because I love video games and I love making them and I want to give players and tinkerers the ability to see how I made it and the ability to make changes of their own.  I'd like the game to live beyond the time I spend working on it and so I am giving you the ability to fully edit the game for your own enjoyment!  If you want to use a portion of my work in your own separate project, please reach out to me for permission.
